Create a sugardough project
---------------------------

1. Get cookiecutter:

   ```sh
   $ pip install cookiecutter
   ```
2. Run cookiecutter with sugardough template

   ```sh
   $ cookiecutter https://github.com/mozilla/sugardough
   ```
3. Done!


Contribute to sugardough
------------------------

To contribute to sugardough development:

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
3. Install development requirements using pip:

   ```sh
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Update the [template directory], and [cookiecutter.json] as well with new
   variables if needed.
5. Run the regeneration script that auto-creates a test site:

   ```sh
   $ ./bin/regenerate.py
   ```
6. Launch the test site to see your changes:

   ```sh
   $ cd test_project/sugardough
   $ docker-compose up
   ```
6. Git commit changes.
7. Pull request!

 [template directory]: https://github.com/mozilla/sugardough/tree/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D
 [cookiecutter.json]: https://github.com/mozilla/sugardough/blob/master/cookiecutter.json

The `regenerate.py` command can also watch for changes and auto-regenerate the
test project:

```sh
$ ./bin/regenerate.py --watch
```

If you want the test project to use a different value for a variable than the
default defined in `cookiecutter.json`, add the value to your
`~/.cookiecutterrc` file:

```
default_context:
    project_name: "Foo Bar"
```


Opinions
--------

* If you want to change the rules for **PEP8**, go and edit the `setup.cfg` file.

* If you want to use **MySQL** instead of PostgreSQL (which is default),
edit the generated `requirements.txt` file and remove the lines about
`psycopg2` then use `peep` to add the version of `MySQL-python` you want to
use. You will also need to edit the `.travis.yml` file accordingly.

* if you want to use **pytest**  add in requirements.txt `pytest`, `py`,
`cov-core` and `pytest-django`.
For test coverage you'll also have to add `pytest-cov`.
Next you'll need to edit the `.travis.yml` file and edit the script part.
Instead of `coverage run manage.py test` it
`py.test --cov=sugardough`.

* Dockerfile uses Python 3. If you want Python 2 change the following line
  ```bash
  apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential python3 python3-dev python3-pip \
  ```
  to
  ```bash
  apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential python python-dev python-pip
  ```
  and remove the next two lines starting with `RUN update-alternatives`.
